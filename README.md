This Python program is an interactive math training application created using the Tkinter library for graphical user interfaces.

It helps users practice basic arithmetic operations:

Addition


Subtraction


Multiplication


Division

----------------------------------


by solving randomly generated math problems and selecting the correct answer from multiple choices.


-----------------------------------


Key Features:

  Random Problem Generation:

  
  For each operation, two random numbers are generated.
  Three possible answers are displayed: the correct answer and two incorrect answers that are close to the correct one.

Interactive Buttons:


The user selects one of the three answers presented as buttons.
If the selected answer is correct, the button turns green;
otherwise, it turns red, and the correct answer is highlighted.

Problem Restart:


After each question, the user can move to the next question by clicking the "Next" button,
which generates a new problem with updated numbers.

-----------------------------

The program uses Tkinter for window design and the Python random module to generate problems.
The structure is modular, with functions dedicated to each arithmetic operation.
